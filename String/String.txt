Student s = new Student(); // s is an object, Student is the data type
String name = "Radha";  // name is an object, String is the data type
name = new String("Radha2"); // since string is immutable, both "Radha" and "Radha2" are created in the memory. There is no replacement.

int a = 5;
a = 6;
a++ // a = 7 since integer is mutable

instances like s, name are stored in the heap memory. 
variable declarations are stored in stack memory.
